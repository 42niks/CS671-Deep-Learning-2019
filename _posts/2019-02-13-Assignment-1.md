## Question 3

### Description
In order to fully understand a fully connected layer, in this problem we are asked to create a dense layer api on top of lower level tensorflow functions like multiply. From the very beginning I've been complaining about having to work on tf1 when tf2 was being released, especially when tf1 api is being ridiculed by many.<br>However, I am ambivalent. I also believe that doing this will help me appreciate deep learning on a _deeper_ level (lol). The underlying concepts will not change, and this should be my only focus.
